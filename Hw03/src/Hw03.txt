Exercise 6.3. Explain the two different uses of the super keyword. How can you tell
when super is used to invoke a constructor?

The keyword super can be used to access a member that is declared in the superclass
(ie call a superclass method or access a superclass field) or to call a constructor defined in the superclass.
When super is used with parentheses (ie super()) it is being used to invoke a constructor from the superclass.


Exercise 6.4. Implement a class
public class LabeledPoint extends java.awt.Point
{
 public LabeledPoint(int x, int y, String text) { . . . }
 public void draw(Graphics g) { . . . }
 private String text;
}
The draw method should draw a small circle and the label. Which methods does this
class inherit?

This class inherits the draw(Graphics g) Method.



Exercise 6.9. Consider the ArrayList<E> and LinkedList<E> classes of the standard
library. What abstract class do they extend? What interface types does that abstract class
implement? Draw a class diagram.

Classes ArrayList<E> and LinkedList<E> both extend abstract class AbstractList<E>. AbstractList<E> implements interface types List<E> and Collection<E>.

«interface» Collection<E> 210.0 10.0 «interface» List<E> 230.0 90.0 <<abstract>> AbstractList<E> 230.0 200.0 ArrayList<E> 90.0 200.0 LinkedList<E> 10.0 300.0 <<abstract>> AbstractSequentialList<E> 190.0 310.0 <<abstract>> AbstractCollection<E> 370.0 90.0

Exercise 6.10. Consider the HashSet<E> and TreeSet<E> classes of the standard library.
What abstract class do they extend? What interface types does that abstract class implement? Draw a class diagram.
HashSet<E> - Extends Abstract<E>, Implements Set<E>, Cloneable, Serializable
TreeSet<E> - Extends Abstracts<E>, Implements NavigableSet<E>, Cloneable, Serializable

Exercise 6.17. Most drawing programs indicate selected items by placing “grabbers”
around the corners. Implement this feature in the scene editor by adding a method
Rectangle getBounds()
to the SceneShape interface type. In the drawSelection method of the SelectableShape
class, call getBounds to determine the grabber locations. Is this an example of the TEMPLATE METHOD pattern?

This is an example of the TEMPLATE METHOD pattern.
The superclass SelectableShape defines the drawSelection(Graphics2D g2) method that calls draw(Graphics2D g2) and getBounds() as primitive operations.
Two subclasses: CarShape and HouseShape supply the primitive operations as is most appropriate for them.


Exercise 6.18. A GeneralPath collects shapes and is itself a shape. What design pattern
does it exemplify?

This is an example of the Composite Pattern.
Since the general path is a shape and collects shapes it treats both
singular instances and groups of objects in the same way.
