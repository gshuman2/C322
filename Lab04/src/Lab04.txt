Exercise 5.3. A slider is a user interface component that allows a user to specify a
continuum of values. To be notified of slider movement, you need to attach a class that
implements the ChangeListener interface type. Read the API documentation for
JSlider and ChangeListener. Make a table of pattern names and actual names that
shows how this is a manifestation of the OBSERVER pattern.

Name in Design Pattern	      Actual Name for JSlider and ChangeListener
Subject	                      JSlider
Observer	                  ChangeListener
ConcreteObserver              The class that implements the ChangeListener interface
attach()	                  addChangeListener()
notify()	                  stateChanged()

Exercise 5.9. Use the COMPOSITE pattern to define a class CompositeIcon that implements the Icon interface type and contains a list of icons. Supply a method
void addIcon(Icon icon, int x, int y)

Exercise 5.11. A Scanner can be used to read numbers and lines from a Reader. Is this an
example of the DECORATOR pattern?

The relationship between Scanner and Reader is not an example of the DECORATOR pattern.
If a Scanner was a DECORATOR for a Reader, then Scanner would have to be a subclass of Reader. However, it is an unrelated class.
